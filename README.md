A DIY irrigation timer, designed for use with 2 row LCD display and 4x3 keypad. Potential for integrating sensor array data capture, wireless connection and control, and GUI development. Currently designed for up to 4 valves.

## Features
Allows individual start time and duration settings for each valve/station. Intervals can be set by weekday or interval of days.

Interfaces with common Arduino peripherals.

## Future work
Most likely a restructuring of the project to allow for easier addition of features.
